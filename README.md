Esoterrible can be installed through Pip. Tested with CPython `3.6.5` and `3.7.1`

```
pip install esoterrible
```

[example_usage.py](https://github.com/rach-sharp/esoterrible/blob/master/example_usage.py)
has examples of the horrible features included.

Feel free to throw some garbage PRs onto this fire.
